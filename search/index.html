<h1>Cued Search</h1>
<p>Welcome to "Cued Search," a web-based experiment that examines how different cues are used in search. Before taking part in this study, please read the consent form below as it describes your rights. Only if you understand the statement and freely consent to participate in the study, you should click on the “I Agree” button at the bottom of the page. If you have any questions, contact the researchers using the e-mail form you can access <a href="mailform.php">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Consent Form</h1>
<p><h2>Purpose of the research</h2></p><p>This study is a web-based experiment designed to understand how people use hints to optimize searching.</p>
<p><h2>What you will be asked to do in the research</h2></p><p>Participation in the study typically takes 5 - 30 minutes, depending on how long you want to participate, and is strictly anonymous. You begin by characterizing the color properties of their screen, so that the colours used in the search experiment itself are approximately similar for all everyone.</p><p>During the actual search task, you have to find one target in a set of other items and then press a key. Just before each search you will be provided one of several cues. The information provided in the cue is always true. Your browser will store information about your responses and what was shown on the screen. A more detailed instruction will come later.</p><p>After some practice searches, participants do 15 searches in a row, and then they are asked if they want to continue their participation, or if they have had enough. After 15 such sets of 15 searches, the experiment stops automatically.</p><p>When you have completed or ended the experiment, we ask you to fill in your age and sex as well as if you use contacts or glasses, and if you know you have any other type of problem with vision (e.g. "color blindness"). The experiment also gathers information on your screen that is relevant to the experiment (luminance information and resolution), as well as identifiers of your computer to make sure people only participate once (MAC and IP address). All collected data will only be used for this study and for no other purpose. When all this has been completed, the data needs to be sent to the experimenters, which will only be done if you press a button to do so.</p>
<p><h2>Risks and discomfort</h2></p><p>We do not foresee any risks or discomfort from your participation in the research beyond what you would experience in every day use of a computer.</p>
<p><h2>Benefits of the research and benefits to you</h2></p><p>Students enrolled in York's URPP can receive (30 minutes?) XXXX credits for participating in this study, by completing the experiment and providing their URPP number as an identifier when sending the data. For everybody else there is no immediate beneift to participation.</p>
<p><h2>Voluntary participation</h2></p><p>Your participation in the study is completely voluntary and you may choose to stop participating at any time. Your decision not to volunteer will not influence your relationship with us or anyone else at York University either now, or in the future.</p>
<p><h2>Withdrawal from the study</h2></p><p>You can stop participating in the study at any time, for any reason, if you so decide. Your decision to stop participating, or to refuse to answer particular questions, will not affect your relationship with the researchers, York University, or any other group associated with this project. In the event you withdraw from the study, all associated data collected will be immediately removed from our computers.</p><p>If you decide to withdraw after the data has been sent to us, we will ask you to provide enough information to identify your data for removal (e.g. date and time of participation and so forth). To make this easier a possibility to provide an identifier is offered at the end, but this is not required. This identifier can be whatever you want, for example your favourite food, a pet's name, your own name, or even a random number, as long as you are able to remember it. In the case of URPP students however, it has to be their URPP number, as this is required to assign credit.</p>
<p><h2>Confidentiality</h2></p><p>All information you supply and recordings of your responses will be held in confidence. The names of participating URPP students will not appear in any report or publication of the research. All data will be safely stored in password protected databases that only research staff have access to. The data might be used for further analyses or publications, but after the first publication all identifiers will be permanently and irrevocably removed from the data.</p>
<p><h2>Questions about the research?</h2></p><p>If you have questions about the research in general or about your role in the study, please feel free to contact the researchers (Dr. Denise Henriques and Dr. Marius 't Hart) using the e-mail form linked below. This research has been reviewed and approved by the Human Participants Review Sub-Committee, York University’s Ethics Review Board and conforms to the standards of the Canadian Tri-Council Research Ethics guidelines.  If you have any questions about this process, or about your rights as a participant in the study, please contact the Sr. Manager & Policy Advisor for the Office of Research Ethics, 5th Floor, York Research Tower, York University (telephone 416-736-5914 or e-mail ore@yorku.ca).</p>
